    "## Background - CCD detectors in Astronomy\n",
    "\n",
    "For your research project, you will be working with imaging data. In modern astronomy ultraviolet, optical and X-ray detectors are charge-coupled devices (CCDs), which are effectively arrays of tiny detectors (pixels), where each pixel converts incoming photons into an electric signal. How effective a CCD is at converting incident photons into charge is referred to as the quantum efficiency (QE), which is heavily dependent on wavelength. It is now possible to have QEs of 70-90% at optical wavelengths (compared to 1-2% for the eye). An example of a QE curve is shown below, which shows high efficiency in the optical regime, peaking at ~700nm, although this will vary depending on the CCD design.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"misc/detector-QEs-FB.gif\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias images\n",
    "To avoid there being negative counts due to fluctuations in the read out noise, a constant voltage is applied, referred to as the bias level. Although in theory this should appear as a constant value added to an astronomical image, in practice pixel-to-pixel variations are also present due to read-out noise. In order to remove the contribution to an image from the bias, we use a *bias frame*, which is a CCD image with an exposure time of zero seconds and shutter closed, so the CCD is simply read out. This bias frame can then be subtracted from the raw image. In practice, several bias frames are averaged together to produce a *master bias frame*, which reduces the impact of readout noise and gives a more accurate estimate of the bias level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flat field\n",
    "The detector and optics of an instrument will always have imperfections that produce variations in sensitivity across the focal plane. To optimise the accuracy of our astronomical images, we therefore need to correct for these variations across the image. This is done using a flat-field, which is a normally exposed image with the entire field of view of the image lit as uniformly as possible (i.e. no sources visible in the image). The main causes for image imperfections are:\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;$\\bullet$ imperfections in the CCD\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;$\\bullet$ vignetting in the optics, where the brightness of an image fades towards the edges\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;$\\bullet$ dust particles anywhere in the optical path\n",
    "\n",
    "These will all affect the flat field in the same way as the astrophysical observation. The flat-field therefore provides a measure of the relative sensitivity of the detector, and dividing an astronomical observation by the (bias-subtracted) flat-field image normalises out these differences in sensitivity from the image. As in the case of the master bias frame, several frames are used to produce a *master flat frame*."

If the true apparent flux of the standard star is in fact 0.03 mag brighter than the value we used in our flux calibration, each data point in our light curve would be 0.03 mag too dim. The uncertainty in the zeropoint (originating from the uncertainty in the standard star apparent magnitude) would thus cause our entire measured light curve to shift up or down, and this is thus referred to as a *systematic* uncertainty.

    "### 4.1 Absolute versus relative flux\n",
    "If the science objectives rely only on the flux *evolution* of a source rather than on the *absolute* flux value, it is no longer necessary to calibrate astronomical observations against a standard star. Instead, we can use changes in the brightness of a non-standard, non-varying star in the field of view to make corrections to our photometry and obtain a light curve with accurate *relative* photometry. Non-standard here means that we do not know the star's apparent magnitude; it has not already been determined previously with other, sensitive, well-calibrated instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative photometry can be very useful, since the fraction of stars that are 'standardised' (i.e. the apparent magnitude is well measured) in certain areas of the sky can be very small (in particular in the southern hemisphere). Astronomical observations thus frequently do not contain any standard stars within the science frame. In this case either separate observations need to be taken of a standard star, which is time consuming and requires very good weather conditions to obtain reliable results (no clouds at all; not even thin clouds), or we can derive the relative photometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how relative photometry works, consider the two background-subtracted light curves below, corresponding to an exoplanet transit and to a non-varying star that have been observed simultaneously with the same instrument. Both light curves are thus obtained using the same bias-subtracted, flat-fielded images."
