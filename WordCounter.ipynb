      " ['Two planets were detected by analysis of a Kepler lightcurve using lomb-scargle periodograms to find periods of 19.23 days and 38.893 days, which puts the planets in mean motion resonance (MMR) as their periods are near exact multiples of each other. By fitting quadratic curves to the transits it was found that the planets, Peanut Butter and Strawberry Jelly, have radii of (8.88$\\\\pm$0.10)$R_{Earth}$ and (8.82$\\\\pm$0.10)$R_{Earth}$, with average densities of (3.41 +0.17/-0.19) x $10^2$ kg/m$^3$ and (4.31 +0.24/-0.26) x $10^2$ kg/m$^3$ respectively. With large radii and low masses, this likely makes the planets gas giants. Analysis of transit timing variations (TTVs), due to being in MMR, gave maximum deviations of 1.4 and 5.8 days, which when compared to theory (Argol 2005), had a 9% and 16% discrepancy from values calculated using masses obtained via private communication. From TTV variations we may get constraints on mass which usually are only obtainable via radial velocity methods.\\n', '\\n'] \n",

      " [\"Exoplanets can be detected via transit methods, radial velocity, direct imaging, microlensing and astrometry. Here, we are going to discuss the transit method and use it to first 'detect' planets orbiting a star system and then derive physical properties of the planets. The first planet detected as outlined by Dunham (2018) via the transit method was HD209458 in 1999 and since then, thousands more have been detected in the same way. In order to use the transit method, there are certain conditions that must be met for detection to be effective. Firstly, the system must be observed edge on such that the planets transit across the face of the star, ideally with inclination of 90 degrees or close to, so a difference in flux can be measured. It follows that the planets must not orbit too far away from the star either, and they must be of significant size in order for the flux drop to be observed. These conditions set up selection effects that influence the type of stars that may be discovered via the transit method.\\n\", '\\n'] \n",

      " ['In order to find the number of planets in this system and their respective periods, we first make use of a lomb-scargle periodogram (Figure 2) with the normalised Kepler lightcurve data. This is done twice so that we are left with only the most prominent peaks that correspond to the periods of the orbiting planets. One can then fold the normalised lightcurve on these periods (adjusting period as necessary to get better folds) to obtain several superimposed transits of the same planet, with the aim of finding a fit that holds generally for all the transits. From the periodogram there are two main peaks at 19.25 and 38.45. If plotted over a larger range then several more peaks are visible, however these correspond to period multiples and are not different planets. While one may then argue that the ~38day period could just be a multiple of the ~19day period, folding the lightcurve at 38.45 reveals that they are in fact different, as an additional smearing of transits can be seen but only surrounding every other main transit dip. Smearing is seen to some degree in all of the folded lightcurves preventing a visibly clean general transit, suggesting the planets are in MMR. Since the periods of the planets suffer from significant TTVs, it is impossible to get a meaningful transit curve that can be accurately modelled by folding the lightcurve. From here on out, I will refer to the planet with a 19 day period as \"Peanut Butter\" and the planet with a 38 day period as \"Strawberry Jelly\".\\n', '\\n'] \n",
