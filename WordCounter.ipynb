      " [\"Exoplanets can be detected via transit methods, radial velocity, direct imaging, microlensing and astrometry. Here, we are going to discuss the transit method and use it to first 'detect' planets orbiting a star system and then derive physical properties of the planets. In order to use the transit method, there are certain conditions that must be met for detection to be effective. Firstly, the system must be observed edge on such that the planets transit across the face of the star, ideally with inclination of 90 degrees or close to, so a difference in flux can be measured. It follows that the planets must not orbit too far away from the star either, and they must be of significant size in order for the flux drop to be observed. These conditions set up selection effects that influence the type of stars that may be discovered via the transit method.\\n\", '\\n'] \n",

      " ['In order to find the number of planets in this system and their respective periods, we first make use of a lomb-scargle periodogram with the normalised lightcurve data. This is done twice so that we are left with only the most prominent peaks that correspond to the periods of the orbiting planets. One can then fold the normalised lightcurve on these periods (adjusting period as necessary to get better folds) to obtain several superimposed transits of the same planet. From the periodogram there are two main peaks at 19.25 and 38.45, although if plotted over a larger range then several more peaks are visible but these correspond to period multiples and are not different planets. While it may seem like the ~38day period could just be a multiple of the ~19day period, folding the lightcurve at 38.45 reveals that they are infact different planets but in MMR. This also explains why the folded lightcurve does not produce a clean transit; the periods of the planets suffer from significant TTVs, meaning it is impossible to get a meaningful transit curve in this way. From here on out, I will refer to the planet with a 19 day period as \"Courteener\" (from \\'Not Nineteen Forever\\' by The Courteeners) and the planet with a 38 day period as \"Vinyl Theatre\" (from \\'30 Seconds\\' by Vinyl Theatre).\\n', '\\n'] \n",
