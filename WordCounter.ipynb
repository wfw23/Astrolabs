However, there is considerable noise in astronomical observations, which has to be taken into account when plotting any photometric data.  Additionally, there might also be systematic errors in your measurement due to incorrect aperture size, contamination from other sources or faulty sky determination. Let us look at how noise affects these lightcurves. We can add noise to the lightcurve as follows:'] \n",
